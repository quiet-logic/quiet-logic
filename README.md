# Hi, I'm Steve

I'm currently exploring software development, aiming at building a more creative and balanced career after years in a different professional world.

Right now I'm working on:

• Python fundamentals and practical problem-solving  
• Command-line workflows, version control, and clean tooling  
• Small scripts that support wellbeing, reflection, and quiet productivity  
• Developing a portfolio through consistent projects

Current project:
• **Calm Log** — a lightweight CLI journaling tool that logs moments of calm in JSONL.

I'm here to build a thoughtful technical foundation and explore where that leads — ideally toward work that blends engineering, creativity, and calm technology.
