# Hi, I'm Steve

I'm currently exploring software development, aiming at building a more creative and balanced career after years in a different professional world.

I'm learning with intention — not rushing, not scrambling — just steady, focused progress and hands-on practice. I care about clarity, calm systems, and technology that genuinely helps people.

Right now I'm working on:

• Python fundamentals and practical problem-solving  
• Command-line workflows, version control, and clean tooling  
• Small scripts that support wellbeing, reflection, and quiet productivity  
• Developing a portfolio through consistent projects, not empty theory

Current project:
• **Calm Log** — a lightweight CLI journaling tool that logs moments of calm in JSONL.

What to expect here:
• Real learning — visible progress over time  
• Straightforward tools, built with care  
• A focus on clarity, readability, and steady craft  
• Work that reflects curiosity, not noise

I'm here to build a thoughtful technical foundation and explore where that leads — ideally toward work that blends engineering, creativity, and calm technology.
